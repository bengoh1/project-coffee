This repository contains the Power BI capstone project for my SG United Skills Associate Data Analyst program. The objective of this project was to showcase the use of Power BI to create interactive dashboards to tell a story from the dataset.

The dataset is a US coffee chain dataset downloaded from https://data.world/qinzhang0131/coffee-sales.  The chain had 156 outlets across 20 states and data spanning 2 years from 2010 to 2011.

An inspiration for this project came from a personal observation that a good cup of coffee is usually found at boutique coffee shops.  However, these shops do not survive more than 5 years on average. From the interactive dashboards, a plausible explanation can be found.  Sales of coffee though profitable, may not be growing fast enough relative to budget compared to tea.  An important component of a good cup of coffee is a good Espresso machine which typically costs upwards of  US$20,000.  Ideally, coffee sales should be growing at or above budget to cover the capital cost of the machine.  But as the data shows, coffee sales are typically below budget. As such, coffee shops that serve a variety of teas alongside coffees are more likely to sustain the business over the long haul.

As there are licences required to view or share on Power BI service, if you would like to view the interactive dashboard, kindly download the file coffee.pbix and view it on Power BI desktop which is free to use.
